Example: [Left/Right]
(Throughout this scene, you will also need to continuously tap SPACE. Begin now.)
*You are sitting in a classroom that looks just like the ones in your high school. The desk is a little cramped, the chair isn’t quite the right height. Your body is just slightly stickier, sweatier, harder to maneuver than you remember. To stay awake, you are [clicking your pen/tapping your foot].
TEACHER: Okay, class… when Jackson… lottery was… traditionally families … for harvest…
You glance to your [left/right], where a [boy/girl] is sitting – your crush. You’re thinking about how they [asked you to a dance/started bullying your friend] and you aren’t sure what to do. Either way, softened by nostalgia, you think of them in the future faintly as your “first [love/heartbreak]”.
The classroom is damp with boredom. Heads hang down like wet towels.
TEACHER: … I said, would anybody be so brave as to answer?
A secret undercurrent of movement ripples through the classroom of teenagers trying to stay awake. To keep busy, you consider etching phallic artwork into your desk. You [do it/restrain yourself].
TEACHER: I know, this classroom is just too [hot/cold]. But we have to make the most of the fifty minutes we have together every day.
STUDENT (mumbling a little too loud): Nobody gives a shit about this stuff anyways.
TEACHER: That’s it, you guys asked for it. Pop quiz. Get out a piece of paper.
Everyone groans. Personally, you [have no idea/are confident about] what your teacher has been saying all period.
TEACHER: One more thing, before you get started. In the spirit of today’s topic, one student will automatically fail this unit. On your paper, you will choose if this is the highest or lowest scoring student. Popular vote wins. Do with this information what you wish.
What? Murmurs, gasps, uninterested chatter. You [are shocked/saw this coming]. Before anybody can object, questions are projected onto the board and an unsettled silence falls over the room. You can't seem to stop tapping.
&QUESTION 1: The topic of today’s class is a [short story/historical account] titled “The Lottery”.
QUESTION 2: The lottery was a [traditional/modern] practice that [brought luck to each family/ensured a good harvest] every year.
QUESTION 3: Families [purchased tickets at the start of the season/were assigned lots based on their household size]. Participation was [compulsory/optional].
QUESTION 4: The families who participated in the lottery hoped to [win/lose].
QUESTION 5: Winning the lottery meant [survival/death].
VOTE: I vote for the [highest/lowest] scoring student to fail.
^Time’s up. The sound of paper shuffling and student discontent. As your teacher tallies the votes, someone speaks up.
[YOU/CLASSMATE]: This is a ridiculous policy. [I refuse to accept this./Why are we being punished?]
Anxious agreement circulates. A certain stillness falls over the room. You stop tapping.#
TEACHER: Before there are any further complaints, I’d like to announce that the $ scoring student will be failing.
(You scored a %
TEACHER: Unfortunately, we can't always have do-overs.
TEACHER: And if we could,
TEACHER: Would you make different choices?
The classroom falls away. You're just sitting at a computer.
