SCENE 4: DREAM
You know, we’ve had this conversation in my head a thousand times. It’s a recurring dream. 
(Hold LEFT SHIFT. Don’t let go of any key or the moment ends.)
Sometimes we’re home, sometimes we’re at work, we’re in the car, we’re on a plane, we’re at the library, we’re at a bar. It’s raining outside or it’s a perfect day or it’s the dead of night. We could be wearing these clothes or totally naked. Sometimes you don’t even have a face. It doesn’t matter. But every single time, I have the perfect words. 
(Hold ENTER.) 
I’m calm. I’m cool. I walk up to you and get real close. In this dream, I’ve carefully crafted the argument for whatever this fight is, and it’s different every time. 
(Hold G.) 
When I speak, I savor every word in my mouth like it’s delicious. Every cell in my body knows that I’m going to win this fight. It’s like I’m being propelled forward, higher power in the shape of my tongue and teeth. 
I never stutter. I never cry. I am always right.
(Hold 0.)
But before I get to my final line, before I get to deliver that finishing blow, you start to laugh.
You start to laugh this condescending, patronizing, almost gleeful laugh. And you go, “aw, I’m sorry, did I make you mad?”
(Hold B.)
And do you know the worst part of these dreams? It’s not that I don’t finish my perfect speech. It’s not that you get the last laugh. It’s not even that I start crying every single time.
The worst part is that I wake up and I realize one day I’m going to have this dream again, and you will never, ever let me have the satisfaction. 
(Hold 1.)
This is the farthest I’ve ever made it.
This is the last time we ever do this.
(Let go.)
I win.
