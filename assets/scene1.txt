SCENE 1: BANGBANGBANG
The play begins in the bathroom of a shitty buffet. You are seated on the toilet with your head in your hands. You try to keep your breath steady – to calm down, but mostly to avoid the stench. Someone bangs on the door. 
STRANGER 1: Hurry it up in there! 
They mutter something foul before giving up. You whisper to yourself. 
YOU: It’s fine. It’s fine. I’ve done this dinner a hundred times. 
The sound of flushing in the other bathroom, then two sets of shuffling footsteps, then a door slam. You let out a breath.
YOU: It’s fine. Get it together. 
Some time passes. Someone bangs on the door. 
YOU (loud enough to hear, but politely): Occupied!
STRANGER 2: Jesus Christ, calm down.
YOU (to yourself): Fuck off. Fuck you.
You check your phone for the time.
YOU: Three minutes. I’m giving myself three more minutes and then I’ll go back out. 
Flush, shuffling, door click. You bounce your leg.
YOU: You know what? I shouldn’t even go out there again. I shouldn’t be here at all. Maybe he already left. Maybe I should just go home. Maybe – 
Someone knocks on the door. 
YOU (louder): OCCUPIED! 
No response.  
YOU: I should just leave. I don’t have to put up with this bullshit. I don’t have to do this. I hate this stupid restaurant. I hate this place. 
You stand up and pace around the small, cramped bathroom. You’re restless. You splash water on your face. Rip up bits of toilet paper. Wash your hands a few times. You grip the sides of the sink and stare at the graffiti-ed mirror. 
YOU: I can’t take this anymore. 
Someone bangs on the door. 
YOU (shouting): It’s occupied! 
Pause. They resume banging on the door. They don’t stop again.
YOU (shouting, louder): I said it’s occupied! 
Bang bang bang. 
YOU: It’s fucking occupied! Are you serious? 
Bang bang bang bang bang. 
YOU: Hello? Is it too much to ask for some privacy? In a bathroom? 
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang. 
YOU: What if I was throwing up in here? What would you want me to do? Open up the door for you? Projectile vomit? Would you want me to just swallow it down? Is that all you need from me? 
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang.
YOU: LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE! I LOCKED THE DOOR FOR A REASON! I SWEAR TO GOD, DO YOU THINK – DO YOU THINK I’M KEEPING IT LOCKED JUST TO DEPRIVE YOU? DO YOU THINK I HAVE SOMETHING YOU WANT? LEAVE ME ALONE! 
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang.
YOU: FUCK OFF! 

YOU: FUCK YOU! 

YOU: I’M LEAVING FOR GOOD!



Silence. 
The banging stops. 
You throw the door open. 
No one is there. 
You take a deep breath and leave.
