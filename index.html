          <li>If nothing happens when you follow the instructions, click anywhere on the page to make sure the site is focused, then try again.</li>
          <li>If you can't progress further in SCENE 1, try pressing multiple keys at a time.</li>
          <li>If you can't progress further in SCENE 2, don't press SHIFT when typing your name.</li>
          <li>If you can't progress further in SCENE 4 even when pressing the correct keys, it might be a keyboard rollover limitation. To read the rest of the scene, you can refresh, hold LEFT SHIFT, then hold the last key you saw. This will skip you ahead.</li>
